This is an implementation of both:
http://dblp.org/rec/conf/mfcs/DominguezF14  and
http://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/DominguezF15,
where a rewrite preserving translation is defined to reduce Combinatory Reduction Systems (CRSs) 
to Nominal Rewrite Systems (NRSs) and vice versa.
Recall that CRSs are extensions of First-Order rewriting with variable binding and Lambda-calculus
at the meta-level whereas NRSs are also extensions of Term Rewrite Systems with variable binding dealt
with by means of permutations and a freshness relation (so, no beta-reduction as primitive but
alpha-equality is internalised as a small logic).
